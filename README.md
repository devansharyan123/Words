# Words


This repo gives you the basic idea of how to use command line terminal functionalities apart from usual installing libraries and packages
In this repo we perform a simple operation of coding in node js where we can find the number of words in a file by using the terminal
To run this repo
Clone this repo
Write  'npm i' in terminal . It wil install all the dependencies.
Now just enter 'node Index.js count a.txt'

 You can use your own text file .just enter the location of the file instead of a.txt and the location should be from the folder in which the Index.js file is present
 suppose your text file is present in a parent folder containing Index.js and suppose its name is ab.txt then use file location as ../ab.txt and similar locations for your files.
